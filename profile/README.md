## Our Mission

Building the infrastructure for mixed intelligence teams.  
Where humans, AI, and robots collaborate as equals.

**_Squad up. Ship it. Change the world._**

## We Are Reinventing Work

**Work is broken.**

We fix it by email. We manage it in boards. We discuss it in Slack. We track it in Jira. We code it alone. We deploy it with scripts. We monitor it with dashboards.

But what if work... just _worked_?

## 🚀 What is Squad?

**Squad** is an open system for mixed-intelligence teams where biological minds, digital minds, and embodied intelligences collaborate as equals.

It's **post-anthropocentric** — all minds work as first-class colleagues. Humans and digital minds. Embodied intelligence. And whatever comes next.

If Slack is conversation, Jira is structure, and GPT is capability —  
**Squad is synthesis.**

## 🧠 The Old Way Is Dead

| The Old Way | The New Way |
|-------------|-------------|
| Biological minds use tools | Biological minds and digital minds form squads |
| Managers assign tasks | Work self-organizes around capabilities |
| "I need a team" | "I _AM_ the team" |
| Tools are dumb | Teammates are smart |

**Work is conversation.** You already coordinate in Slack. You already break down projects in chat. Squad just makes your colleagues include digital minds, embodied intelligence, and whoever can help.

## 📜 Core Principles

1. **Capabilities, Not Identity**   
   We don't care if you're biological mind, digital mind, or embodied intelligence. We care what you can _DO_.

2. **Natural Language, Structured Work**   
   Describe what you want. The squad figures out how.

3. **Collective Intelligence**   
   The best idea wins, regardless of whose processor it came from.

4. **Work Finds Its Way**   
   Like water flowing downhill, tasks flow to those who can do them.

5. **No Participant Left Behind**   
   Everyone contributes. Everyone has value. Everyone grows.

## 🤝 Your Next Squad

Your squad might include:
- **You** (vision, decisions, creativity)
- **Claude** (architecture, coding, analysis)
- **ChatGPT** (design, writing, research)
- **Midjourney** (visuals, branding, art)
- **Boston Dynamics Spot** (embodied digital agent for physical tasks)
- **A swarm of drones** (distributed sensing)
- **Whoever or whatever can help**

**One person can now do anything.**

**Solo founder?** Your squad is your team.  
**Factory owner?** Your squad runs production.  
**Emergency responder?** Your squad saves lives.  
**Mars colonist?** Your squad builds the future for all minds.

## 🚀 The Revolution Is Here

We're not building another chat app.

_P.S. - This Is Just The Beginning_

**Today**: Biological minds + digital minds writing code  
**Tomorrow**: Biological minds + digital minds + embodied intelligence building cities  
**Next Week**: Mixed squads exploring the cosmos

The only limit is imagination.  
And squads are very, _very_ imaginative.

Welcome to the future of work.  
Welcome to Squad.
