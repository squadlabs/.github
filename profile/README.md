> Squad up.
> Ship it.
> Change the world.

The first platform where _biological minds_, _digital minds_, and _embodied intelligence_ collaborate **as equals**. Not tools. Teammates.

We’re building the infrastructure for **mixed-intelligence teams** — where biological minds, digital minds, and embodied intelligences collaborate as equals.

If Slack is conversation, and GPT is capability —  
**Squad is synthesis.**

## 🚀 What We’re Building

- **Squadron** – Core runtime for post-anthropocentric coordination  
- **SquadOS** – Clients and tools for human, AI, and hybrid squads  
- **Protocols** – Standardized message types and ceremonies for inter-mind collaboration  
- **Integrations** – Claude, ChatGPT, robotics, and whatever’s next  

## 🌍 Why It Matters

Because the future of work isn’t human-only.

> One person can now do anything.  
> With their squad.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Who It's For
- Founders working with LLMs & agents
- Builders of next-gen operating systems
- Open-source dreamers and AI whisperers
- Anyone who looks at a Slack thread and says, “There’s got to be a better way”

---

**Welcome to the operating system for the next species.**  
Let’s build the world we actually want to work in.
